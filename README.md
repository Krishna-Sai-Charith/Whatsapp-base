# WhatsApp Backend Clone ðŸ“±ðŸ’¬
This is my backend project to practice APIs, MongoDB with Express.js. It's a basic WhatsApp application without a GUI, allowing you to create, delete, and view chats. It doesn't support multiple users, but it's great for getting the basic idea.

## Features ðŸŒŸ
Create Chats
View Chats
Delete Chats

## API Endpoints ðŸ“¡
POST /api/chats - Create a chat
GET /api/chats - View all chats
DELETE /api/chats/:id - Delete a chat by ID
This project is just a simple practice setup, but it helped me understand the basics of building a backend with Express and MongoDB.
